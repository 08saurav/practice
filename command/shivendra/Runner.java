/*                -------------------------------- Command Design Pattern --------------------------------
 * Suppose we have a request object that need not be processes immediately i.e. have to passed through multiple middlewares
 * e.g. logger, authoriser, auditor etc. they it would be better to have request object(can be called command) and we will
 * have sender(invoker) and reciever(executor)
 */

/* The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object,
 * allowing you to parameterize objects with different requests, queue or log requests,
 * and support undoable operations.
 * It decouples the sender (the object that initiates the request) from the receiver (the object that performs the request).
 */

 /* Components of Command Design Pattern:
  * Command: An interface or abstract class that defines the execute() method to perform an action.
  * Concrete Command: A class that implements the Command interface and defines the specific actions to be executed on the receiver.
  * Receiver: The actual object that performs the business logic of the command.
  * Invoker: The object that triggers the execution of the command.
  * Client: The object that creates the command, associates it with a receiver, and assigns it to an invoker.
  */

/* When to Use the Command Pattern
   To encapsulate a request as an object, enabling you to:
   1. Queue commands.
   2. Log commands for audit or debugging.
   3. Support undo/redo functionality.
   4. To decouple the sender of a request from the receiver.
   5. When you want to implement a transactional model where operations can be executed, reversed, or retried.
 */

/*
Benefits of the Command Pattern
Flexibility:
Commands can be dynamically assigned, making the system more configurable and extensible.

Reusability:
Commands can be reused in different contexts (e.g., for manual triggers, automation, or undo operations).

Separation of Concerns:
The sender doesnâ€™t need to know how the receiver performs the action, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

Support for Complex Operations:
Commands can encapsulate a sequence of operations (e.g., a macro command).
*/

/*   Real World Examples  */
/*
GUI Applications:
Buttons, menus, or keyboard shortcuts trigger commands (e.g., "Save", "Undo", "Redo").

Task Schedulers:
Queue and execute tasks like sending emails or generating reports at specific times.

Home Automation Systems:
Commands are used to control devices (lights, fans, TVs) based on user input or triggers.

Undo/Redo in Text Editors:
Each operation (e.g., typing, deleting) is encapsulated as a command for undo/redo functionality.

Game Development:
Player actions (move, attack) are stored as commands to support undo, replay, or AI simulations.
