 /*
  * Factory Design Pattern
  * It gives an Interface for creating objects from a superclass
  * When it should be used :
  * It is to be used when type of objects to be created needs to be determined at time of run time or users input.
  * This pattern simplifies the object creation process by placing it in a dedicated method
    , promoting loose coupling between the object creator and the objects themselves.
  * The client does not need to know the details of how the object is created, just that it needs a particular type of object.
  * The factory can decide which class to instantiate based on parameters, configuration, or user input.
  * If the process of creating an object is complicated (e.g., involves multiple steps, dependencies, or configuration),
    you can isolate this complexity in the factory.
  */


/*
 * Key Concepts:
Product: The object that is created by the factory (e.g., a Car, Truck, or Motorcycle).
Factory: A class or method responsible for creating instances of products.
Client: The user or consumer who requests a product from the factory but doesnâ€™t know the exact type of product it is.
 */

/*
 * This Design Pattern Helps us in maintaining Single Responsibiltity Principle 
 * for e.g. if there is change in way of creation of objects there would be only one class to be changed not 
 * all the classes needs to be changed which helps in having maintanable and scalable code.

 When Not to Use the Factory Pattern
    The Factory pattern is useful in many scenarios, but it's not always the best choice.
    Here are some situations where it might be better to avoid it:
    Simple Object Creation: If objects are simple and don't require complex creation logic or families of related products, 
    the Factory pattern might be overkill.
    Frequent Changes to Object Creation: If the object creation logic is constantly changing, 
    using a Factory might lead to a lot of churn and increase maintenance cost.
    No Clear Family of Products: If there are no distinct families of related products that require different variations 
    (i.e., when the need for decoupling object creation isn't strong), then a factory might be unnecessary.
